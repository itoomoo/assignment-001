    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p  class="para">

        This year my mission is to complete the FrontEnd Developer Course properly.
        The first priority is to learn properly, no matter how much try it takes.
        Except that, I wanna read at least 40 productive books and watch great movies.
        Last but not the least, I wanna gain some weight and make a tour to Saint Martin.

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p  class="para">

    I can't say I'm very much visionary, but this year I wanna make some changes about it.
    I wanna take some serious decesions and try my best to achive the goals. No toxicity.
    Make some time for myself and adore those who really cares.

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p  class="para">

    Still I'm bit of a childish. So the goals are impacted by that part too.
    This year I wanna buy some exotic gaming gadgets. Wanna make a tour with friends, which basically limited to planning.
    And the most priority is to finish this FrontEnd Developing Course with full focus and make some progress in this field.
